# Boudy's Timer
A clone of Tom Francis' "Tom's Timer" app made with Java Swing.  
It's a simple timer program that tells you how long you've been on a break or working and shows the time in the task bar.  
Here is a blog post about the latest version of Tom's timer https://www.pentadact.com/2023-08-06-toms-timer-5/  
What a man!
